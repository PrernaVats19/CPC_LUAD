# UALCAN Database Information

* **Full Database Name:** The University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal
* **Version Used:** 2022
* **Access Date(s):** [02-05-2025]
* URL:** (https://ualcan.path.uab.edu) 
* **Description of Data Used:** UALCAN is a comprehensive, user-friendly, and interactive web resource for analyzing cancer OMICS data. It is built on PERL-CGI with high quality graphics using javascript and CSS. UALCAN is designed to, a) provide easy access to publicly available cancer OMICS data (TCGA, MET500, CPTAC and CBTTC), b) allow users to identify biomarkers or to perform in silico validation of potential genes of interest, c) provide graphs and plots depicting expression profile and patient survival information for protein-coding, miRNA-coding and lincRNA-coding genes, d) evaluate epigenetic regulation of gene expression by promoter methylation, e) perform pan-cancer gene expression analysis, f) Provide additional information about the selected genes/targets by linking to GeneCards, Pubmed, TargetScan, The human protein atlas, DRUGBANK, Open Targets and the GTEx. These resources allow researchers to gather valuable information and data about the genes/targets of interest, g) provide clinical proteomic consortium data analysis including total/phospho-proteins and h) provide pediatric brain tumor gene expression and protein expression analysis.
* **Key Parameters/Filters Applied:** TCGA cancer types, specific gene queries (BIRC5, CDCA8, INCENP, AURKB), various clinicopathological parameters.
* **Licensing Information:** Refer to the UALCAN website for specific licensing details.
