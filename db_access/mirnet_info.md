# miRNet Database Information

* **Full Database Name:** miRNet
* **Version Used:** As available at time of access.
* **Access Date(s):** [Insert Date(s) of Access, e.g., 2025-07-25]
* **Persistent Identifier/URL:** [miRNet Official Website](https://www.mirnet.ca/) (Common URL, specific version/tool may vary)
* [cite_start]**Description of Data Used:** Used to determine miRNAs associated with CPC genes and for network analysis[cite: 519]. [cite_start]Specifically, it was used to find miRNAs in the network and to show direct proximity of hsa-let-7b-5p with CPC genes [cite: 524][cite_start], and for network analysis showing direct association between CPC genes, hsa-let-7b-5p, and TMPO-AS1[cite: 557].
* **Key Parameters/Filters Applied:** miRNA-gene interaction networks, concentric circle analysis.
* **Licensing Information:** Refer to the miRNet website for specific licensing details.
