# ClusPro 2.0 Database Information

* **Full Database Name:** ClusPro 2.0
* **Version Used:** 2.0 
* **Access Date(s):** 23-05-2025
* **URL:** https://cluspro.bu.edu/login.php 
* **Description of Data Used:** This is a protein-protein docking server. The data it uses are the 3D structures of two proteins (in PDB format). It employs a three-stage procedure using algorithms like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and PIPER to predict and evaluate the energies of billions of docked conformations to determine the best possible binding model.
* **Key Parameters/Filters Applied:** Protein-protein docking, weighted scores.
* **Licensing Information:** Refer to the ClusPro 2.0 website for specific licensing details.
